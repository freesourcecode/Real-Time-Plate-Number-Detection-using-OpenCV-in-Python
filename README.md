# Real-Time Plate Number Detection using OpenCV in Python

The **Real-Time Plate Number Detection Project was developed using Python and OpenCV**. 

License Plate Recognition is an image-processing technology used to identify vehicles by their license plates.

This technology is widely applied in various security and traffic management systems.

The **Plate Number Detection system in Python** aims to recognize license plates. 

To achieve this, **OpenCV** is used to detect the plates, while Python’s Pytesseract library extracts the characters and digits from them.

If you are new to Python programming and are unfamiliar with using a Python IDE, I have compiled a list of the **[best Python IDEs for Windows, Linux, and macOS](https://itsourcecode.com/blogs/best-python-ide-for-windows-2021/)** to help you get started.

I also provide instructions on **[how to download and install the latest version of Python on Windows](https://itsourcecode.com/blogs/how-to-download-and-install-latest-version-of-python-on-windows-2021/)**.

To begin executing the **Real-Time Plate Number Detection** project, make sure you have installed Python 3.9 and PyCharm on your computer.
